## Statistical Analysis

This tab allows you to perform statistical analysis on your loaded dataset. 

#### Get Predictive Metrics

To perform advanced analysis we remove links from the network randomly based frequency of drug target associations. The method then re-predicts the links performs statistical analysis how well those remove links can be predicted and which algorithm shows better performance. Five of the statistical metrics used to show the performance **AUAC**(Area under the accumulation curve),**auc**(Area under curve), **auctop**(10%) ,**bedroc** and **enrichment factor**. The results dynamically adds up the table and at each run to the table. One can select three algorithms for calculation of the statistics

* **Choose Random links to be removed**

Remove links from the network randomly

* **Frequency of associations between Biparite Nodes**

Remove the nodes from network which are having more than certain frequency of drug target associations.
