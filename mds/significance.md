## Permutation Testing

This tab allows you to perform permutation testing on your loaded dataset. 

#### Perform Permutations Analysis on your Network

Next part of the advanced analysis tab perfoms link significant analysis where from the given network 
random permutations are computed using the given number of permutations and only the 
significant links with pvalue less than 0.05 are kept. 

* **Choose number of random permutations**

Perform random permutations of the network. As the number of random permutations increases the
computing time increases 

* **Keep Significant links of pvalue**

set the threshold for links to kep in the results table.
